    //       Exercise Three

    // Do not worry about the real operations to get the values, the goal of these exercises is to understand
    // how real world conditions can be represented with code.

    // 1. You have rented some movies for your kids: The little mermaid (for 3 days),
    // Brother Bear (for 5 days, they love it), and Hercules (1 day, you don't know yet if they're going to like it).
    // If price for a movie per day is $3, how much will you have to pay?

    // 2. Suppose you're working as a contractor for 3 companies: Google, Amazon and Facebook,
    // they pay you a different rate per hour. Google pays $400, Amazon $380, and Facebook $350.
