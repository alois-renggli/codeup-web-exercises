    <dd class="invisible"><p>Fewer than one-third of the national parks charge entrance fees.
        You can obtain park entrance passes by visiting a park site that charges an entrance fee.
        Entrance fee sites have passes available; we recommend calling a park prior to your visit.
        (See the park search to locate a specific park.) There are a number of entrance passes available,
        including park-specific passes as well as passes that offer entrance to more than 2,000 federal
        recreation sites in addition to the national parks (Annual, Military, Senior, 4th Grade, Access,
        and Volunteer passes). Learn more about the America the Beautiful - The National Parks and Federal
        Recreational Lands Pass.</p></dd>

        Ferry Center map collection.</p></dd>

    <dd class="invisible"><p>For campground reservations, visit Recreation.gov.
        Not all parks participate in this service; many campgrounds are first come, first served.
        For more information on specific camping and lodging services offered at the park(s) of your
        interest, please check specific park websites. You can also learn more about camping in
        national parks and find a map of parks with camping opportunities.</p></dd>

        the Pacific (Pearl Harbor), many Mammoth Cave National Park cave tours, Independence National
        Historical Park tours, and more. Not all parks participate in this reservation service.
        For more information on tours offered at a specific park, please see the park search.</p></dd>
    <dt>9. Can I bring my pet to a national park?</dt>

    <dt>10. What do I need to know about driving off road in national parks?</dt>
    <dd class="invisible"><p>Before you head out, check with the national parks that you intend to visit.

        the National Park Service regulates it.</p></dd>
